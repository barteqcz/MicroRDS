### Why was the name changed?

The project name has been changed because I discovered an older project with the same name. Since they were first, it was only fair to choose a new name for mine. **Welcome NanoRDS!**

### Key Features:

- Lightweightness: Designed with efficiency in mind, the system boasts minimal resource requirements, ensuring optimal performance on a variety of hardware configurations.

- Extensive protocol support: Built-in compatibility for PS, PTY, PI, RT, RT+, CT, PTYN, ECC, LIC, AF.

- Seamless script usage: Flexibility of using familiar scripting languages like Bash, Python, and more, to effortlessly control RDS through FIFO.
